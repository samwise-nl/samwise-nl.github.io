      <description>In my current role as a senior software developer/team lead I get to look over a lot of resumes - from interns, to junior coders right up to very experienced developers. Over time you see a few repeating patterns that you really wish you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t. Most of them are pretty minor in the scheme of things, but when you&amp;rsquo;re looking at dozens of resumes and you&amp;rsquo;re looking for ways to narrow the selection pool why put yourself in the reject pile?</description>

      <description>Hi! I&#39;m Sam Russell - husband, father, software developer, avid photographer and guitarist and probably a few other descriptive terms (hopefully all positive!). This is my little piece of the internet where you can find some links to my online persona(s) and some of my blogs posts and tidbits that I hope to share over the coming months and years.
Whatever your reason for visiting, I hope you find something entertaining, of interest or insightful here.</description>

      <description>Just going to leave this here for the time-being.
Hugo is really super fast!
Some Code sections var s = &amp;#34;JavaScript syntax highlighting&amp;#34;; alert(s); s = &amp;#34;Python syntax highlighting&amp;#34; print s No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. But let&amp;#39;s throw in a &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;tag&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;. 1 2 3 4 5 6 const canvas = document.querySelector(&amp;#39;canvas&amp;#39;); const ctx = canvas.getContext(&amp;#39;2d&amp;#39;); const width = canvas.width = window.innerWidth; const height = canvas.height = window.innerHeight; </description>
